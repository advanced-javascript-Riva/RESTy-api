# RESTy-api

#### Author: Riva Davidowski

### Project Overview:

**Phase 1: My goal is to setup the basic scaffolding of the application, with intent being to add more functionality to the system as I go. This initial build sets up the file structure so that I can progressively build this application in a scalable manner.

This first phase involves entering the URL to a REST API and selecting the REST method to use to access it. Providing a visual confirmation that  entries and selections are valid is another goal so I know that the application will be able to fetch the API data that I’ve requested.

#### Usability: 

**Getting Started with Create React App**

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The entry point for this application is `App.js`.

- To create a React application, run `npx create-react-app (name of project here, all lowercase)`
- To install it globally, run ‘npm install -g create-react-app’

## Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
